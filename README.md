# twoday-recruitment-case

## WIP
I made this branch so that you could look at the code without having to worry about any changes I make to the codebase. It will remain static for this purpose. Currently the code is messy and the logic is not there yet, as I've mostly been focusing on the structure of the project. I plan to implement basic user input, but right now the program will just run all the test cases.

## Assumptions
I have assumed that the point of the exercise was to only implement the business logic and test cases, and not set up any databases or ui.
